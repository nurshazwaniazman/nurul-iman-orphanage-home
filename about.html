                  <h2>Who Are Us?</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 5%; padding: 2%;">Perak State Kasih Nurul Iman Welfare Organization (Reg. No.3092-11-PRK) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that actively carrying out activities to provide protection, care and education to poor orphans for free. Nurul Iman Perak Orphanage Home will help all eligible orphans regardless of the child's race, education or discipline before the children are taken. We will only accept children under the age of 12 unless the family has a brother or sister who is over 12 years old but still under 18 years old, then all of them will be accepted. Nurul Iman Orphanage Home is professionally managed by four officers and six support staff.</p>
                  <h2>History of Establishment</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%; padding: 2%;">Perak State Kasih Nurul Iman Welfare Organization or also can called as Nurul Iman Orphanage Home was established at the end of 2000 with the original name of Yayasan Nurul Iman.
                    Nurul Iman Orphanage Home was founded by Encik Khairul Anuar Bin Mohmad Razi (Former President). Established with the hope of helping underprivileged children such as orphans by providing shelter and the opportunity to get a perfect education. 
                    In the early stages of its establishment, was managed by a committee. The committee has appointed En. Khairul Anuar Bin Mohmad Razi as the Manager or Supervisor of the hostel. He is the person in charge of all matters relating to the operation of the hostel except in matters relating to assets and finances. For some reason in 2004 the operation moved to Jalan Intan, Kampung Dato Ahmad Said.
                    
                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%; padding: 2%; margin-top: -25px">On 9 October 2006, Mr. Khairul Anuar has officially registered the Nurul Iman Perak Orphanage Home as a sole proprietorship. On the 12 October, Mr. Khairul Anuar has made a sworn statement to confirm that the Nurul Iman Perak Orphanage Home conducts activities for free.
                    At the end of 2005 again these children were moved, this time due to the failure of us to fund the operating costs of the hostel and problems with the rented landlord. As a result of facing problems too often, then Mr. Khairul Anuar is determined to take over the full operation of the Nurul Iman Hostel from the Nurul Iman and its Committee.
                    To expand the protection of orphans, In June 2010, En. Khairul Anuar has opened another Nurul Iman (Branch) in Kampung Pinang, Kamunting, Taiping which accommodates only boys but was closed on 1 September 2016 due to lack of support.
                    And on 30 June 2011, Nurul Iman Perak Orphanage Home was established under the Registrar of Societies. This establishment is to streamline the administration and fulfill the requirements of the Social Welfare Department.</p>
